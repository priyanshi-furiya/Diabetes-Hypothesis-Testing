# Random Process and Estimation Technique Project 

This project applied statistical analysis and hypothesis testing on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to determine if various medical factors collectively influence diabetes risk.

## Problem Statement

The key question investigated: 

*Is there a set of factors, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, insulin, age, and pregnancies that collectively influence diabetes risk in a sample population of women?*

## Hypothesis Testing Techniques Used

Several statistical tests were utilized:

- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Checks if data matches a normal distribution 
- **Independent T-Test**: Compares means of two groups to see if difference is significant
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Checks if means of three or more groups are significantly different
- **Chi-Squared Test**: Tests if categorical variables are related or independent

## Hypotheses Tested

Specific hypotheses tested on the dataset:

- Blood pressure is higher in diabetic patients
- BMI is higher in diabetic patients
- Insulin levels are higher in diabetic patients 
- Age is greater in diabetic patients
- Number of pregnancies impacts diabetes risk

## Conclusion 

The analysis showed that increased blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, age and pregnancies are associated with higher diabetes risk, providing evidence that these factors collectively influence diabetes likelihood.

The project was an exercise in statistical analysis and hypothesis testing of medical data using Shapiro-Wilk, T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Squared tests. It improved our skills in selecting and applying the appropriate statistical tests based on data types and analysis objectives.
